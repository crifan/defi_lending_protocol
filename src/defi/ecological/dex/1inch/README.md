  * 概述 
    * The 1inch Network unites decentralized protocols whose synergy enables the most lucrative, fastest and protected operations in the DeFi space. 
    * Best For Large Swaps (Outside US) 
    * Both ParaSwap and 1inch are available to non-US traders. 1inch can break up large swaps into smaller batches to help you get the most tokens for your trade. 
    * 1inch may be the best-known DEX aggregator. It looks a lot like Uniswap but pulls swap options from a plethora of DEXs. There’s a reason it’s so popular: In the background, 1inch is actually breaking up your trade (if needed) to prevent price spikes and get you the most tokens in your swap. The bad news: US users are in a “restricted jurisdiction” and can’t use the service. 
    * Price impact is one of the most challenging parts of using DEXs. Basically, as you buy more from the pool, the price increases — sometimes by a lot. 1inch automatically splits your swap between several pools if needed to minimize the price impact and get the tokens you need at the best price possible.

    * People outside the US 
      * 1inch is one of our favorite DEX aggregators, but you can’t use it in the US. Rats. It’s really good. 
    * People who want peer-to-peer transfers 
      * Want a secure way to trade tokens once you’ve struck up a deal? 1inch lets you set up the swap and copy a link to the online trade. Nice and safe. Similarly, you can also set up limit orders on 1inch.
